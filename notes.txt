To run web server:

  # From the project directory
  plackup lifter_http.psgi

And then you can hit http://localhost:5000/?map=contest1.map

I haven't gotten it to accept moves yet :)

-----

# Run tests
prove -Ilib t

------

# Run the random bot on contest1.map
./manager -b <path to bot> [-v] -m <path to map> [<path to another map> ...]

E.G.

./manager -b bot/random.pl -m maps/*

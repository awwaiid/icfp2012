To run web server:

  # From the project directory
  plackup lifter_http.psgi

And then you can hit http://localhost:5000/?map=contest1.map

I haven't gotten it to accept moves yet :)

-----

# Run tests
prove -Ilib t

------

# Run the random bot on contest1.map
./manager -b <path to bot> [-v] -m <path to map> [<path to another map> ...]

E.G.

./manager -b bot/random.pl -m map/*

./manager -b bot/genie.pl -m map/contest1.map -t 5

Bot strategies

* Random
** Literally select a move at random
** Better than nothing... well... sometimes

* Scaredy
** Check immediate moves for lambdas
** If there is one near you, go there
** Abort if there is no lambda one move away

* N-look-ahead
** Try every combination N deep
** Select path with max score

* Path Finding
** Given a destination, return a set of steps to get there
** A* Algorithm?

* Genetic Algorithm
** Better than random!
** Attempts N moves, searches for maximal score using population-generation search
** OK for short term
** Gets into local maxima easily -- not good for tricky problems

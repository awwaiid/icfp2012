We developed 3 major bots and a web-based UI. Our core code is written in
Perl5, and one bot and the UI are written in PHP (and js). We also built a
'manager' which helped us test the bots. Oh, and a small perl test suite.

The bots:

* genie_orig.pl - uses AI::Genetic to evolve a set of moves for a given map.
  This is what was submitted for the lightning round, and was initially better
  than the other bots.

* look_ahead.pl - Tries N moves ahead, and keeps the highest score. Along with
  some other minor heuristics, such as a simple abort-if-impossible

* phpbot.php - Uses much better hand-made heuristics and position evaluation
  and path finding to decide, in chunks of 22 moves, what to do next.

We ran them against all of the organizer maps, and phpbot.php is the best!
